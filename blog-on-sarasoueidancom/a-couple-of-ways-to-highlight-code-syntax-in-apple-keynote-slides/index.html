<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/keynote/">Apple Keynote</a> doesn&rsquo;t come with code syntax highlighting built in. I <em>really</em> wish it did, and hope that Apple would at some point add this feature, especially considering how many developers and engineers use Keynote to create talk slides.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, I used to take screenshots of code snippets to include them in my presentations. That was <em>very</em> impractical. If I wanted to make changes to the code, I&rsquo;d have to rewrite it, take a screenshot again, and copy-paste it into Keynote once again. That soon became tiring and highly ineffective.</p>
<p>Today, I know of two quick and easy ways to include &ldquo;real&rdquo; syntax highlighted code in Keynote. This post is me dumping my thoughts into my own &ldquo;<a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pensieve">Pensieve</a>&quot;—<em>this blog!</em>—for my future self to reference, and for anyone else who might find these tips useful.</p>
<h2 id="copy-pasting-formatted-code-from-vs-code">Copy-pasting formatted code from VS Code</h2>
<p>A few years ago I learned that copying code from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> to Keynote would preserve the formatting of the pasted code, i.e. I could include real code (text) snippets in my slides with syntax highlighting applied to them. That was a game changer! Shortly after learning that, I installed VS Code on my machine and used it solely for that purpose for quite a while (before I eventually made the complete switch from <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>).</p>
<p>To ensure code snippets in my slides have proper and accessible contrast, I typically enable VS Code&rsquo;s High Contrast theme when I&rsquo;m writing code for my presentations. (I&rsquo;ve used the High Contrast theme for daily coding sessions as well for years.)</p>
<p><em>Today</em>, I learned that this VS Code feature is actually a setting (<code>editor.copyWithSyntaxHighlighting</code>) that can be enabled and disabled in VS Code editor settings. I learned this after <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1396493483943337984?s=20">asking</a> for suggestions for alternative ways to highlight code in Keynote after noticing that the code I was copying from VS Code was no longer preserving its formatting. (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronbassett">Aaron Bassett</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronbassett/status/1396495691929821185?s=20">the tip</a>). Turns out the setting wasn&rsquo;t enabled after the last fresh install I did.</p>
<p>If you search for <code>copyWithSyntaxHighlighting</code> in VS Code settings, you can find the option that enables/disables it and turn it on/off:</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can manually set the value to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> in your user Settings file.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-slides-code-highlighter-web-app">Using the Slides Code Highlighter Web app</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t use VS Code and don&rsquo;t want to install it for the sole purpose of copy-pasting code snippets into Keynote, you can use <a href="https://romannurik.github.io/SlidesCodeHighlighter/">Slides Code Highlighter</a> tool by <a href="https://twitter.com/romannurik">Roman Nurik</a>, kindly <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1396494912019861508?s=20">shared by Addy Osmani</a> today.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://twitter.com/jamie_gaskins/status/1396494700874539013?s=20">other</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/frontstuff_io/status/1396498521356918784?s=20">approaches</a> to go around this, and probably more that I may not be aware of, but the above two approaches are simple and fast enough to work for me for now.</p>
<p>Of course, none of these approaches are as convenient as having built-in syntax highlighting in Keynote. Maybe, someday, Apple will add this feature. Until then, we can only make do with what we got.</p>
