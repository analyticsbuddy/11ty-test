<div class="pf-content"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Any organization not explicitly and constitutionally right-wing will sooner or later become left-wing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the topic of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-22/corporate-america-is-not-as-woke-as-it-appears?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=view&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my latest Bloomberg column</a>, here is one excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="paywall">Additional forces strengthen Conquest’s Second Law. Educational polarization increasingly characterizes U.S. politics, with more educated Americans more likely to vote Democratic. Those same Americans are also likely to run nonprofits or major corporations, which would partially explain the ideological migration of those institutions.</p>
<p class="paywall">There are, of course, numerous U.S. institutions that have maintained or even extended a largely right-wing slant, including many police forces, significant parts of the military, and many Protestant Evangelical churches. Those institutions tend to have lower educational requirements, and so they are not always so influential in the media, compared to many left-wing institutions.</p>
<p class="paywall">Furthermore, the military and police are supposed to keep out of politics, and so their slant to the right is less noticeable, although no less real. The left is simply more prominent in mass media, so Conquest’s Second Law appears to be truer than it really is. (Note that by definition the law excludes explicitly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">right-wing media</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="paywall">The common thread to these explanations is that left-wing views find it easier to win in spheres of reporting, talk and rhetoric — and that those tendencies strengthen over time.</p>
<p class="paywall">It follows that, if Conquest’s Second Law is true, societies are more right-wing than they appear. Furthermore, it is the intelligentsia itself that is most likely to deluded about this, living as it does in the world of statements and proclamations. It is destined to be repeatedly surprised at how “barbarian” American society is.</p>
<p class="paywall">There is also a significant strand of right-wing thought, most notably in opposition to Marxism, that stresses the immutable realities of human nature, and that people change only so much in response to their environments. So all that left-wing talk doesn’t have to result in an entirely left-wing society.</p>
<p>Conservatives thus should be able to take some comfort in Conquest’s Second Law. They may find the discourse suffocating at times. But there is more to life than just talk — and that, for liberals as well as conservatives, should be counted as one of life’s saving graces.</p></blockquote>
