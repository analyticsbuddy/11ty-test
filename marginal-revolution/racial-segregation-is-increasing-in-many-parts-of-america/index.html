<div class="pf-content"><blockquote><p>Some of the nation&#8217;s largest metropolitan regions have become increasingly segregated in the last 30 years, underscoring racial inequalities that have led to poorer life outcomes in Black and brown neighborhoods, <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/roots-structural-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a study</a> released Monday by the University of California Berkeley&#8217;s Othering &amp; Belonging Institute.</p>
<p>The study found that 81% of regions with more than 200,000 residents were more segregated in 2019 than they were in 1990, despite fair housing laws and policies created to promote integration.</p>
<p>Some of the most segregated areas included Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit in the Midwest and New York, northern New Jersey and Philadelphia in the mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p>Conversely, large metropolitan regions that saw the biggest decrease in segregation included Savannah, Georgia, San Antonio and Miami.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/21/us/housing-segregation-cities-berkeley-study/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the full story</a>, exactly as I argued in my earlier book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complacent-Class-Self-Defeating-Quest-American-ebook/dp/B01JGMCCCQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+complacent+class&amp;qid=1624370074&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Complacent Class</a>.  Via Ilya Novak.  And from the study, don&#8217;t forget this:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Southern states have lower overall levels of segregation</strong>, and the <strong>Mountain West and Plains states have the least</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch&#8230;!</p>
