<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Not all the time, but often, the attractive get the first-class treatment. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/explaining-financial-and-prosocial-biases-in-favor-of-attractive-people-interdisciplinary-perspectives-from-economics-social-psychology-and-evolutionary-psychology/BB9900C25A6052CBE71D0BD4FF9B29E8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research suggests</a> they are more likely to be offered job interviews, more likely to be hired when interviewed and more likely to be promoted than less attractive individuals. They are more likely to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://law.stanford.edu/press/who-speaks-for-the-ugly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">receive loans</a> and more likely to receive lower interest rates on those loans.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">The discriminatory effects of lookism are pervasive. Attractive economists are more likely to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3805308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study at</a> high-ranked graduate programs and their papers are cited more often than papers from their less attractive peers. One study found that when unattractive criminals committed a moderate misdemeanor, their fines were about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167291175009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four times as large</a> as those of attractive criminals.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Daniel Hamermesh, a leading scholar in this field, observed that an American worker who is among the bottom one-seventh in looks earns about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/opinion/sunday/ugly-you-may-have-a-case.html">10 to 15 percent less</a> a year than one in the top third. An unattractive person misses out on nearly a quarter-million dollars in earnings over a lifetime.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">The overall effect of these biases is vast. One 2004 study <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/08/23/who-will-fight-beauty-bias/Kq3pbfOy4VRJtlKrmyWBNO/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found that</a> more people report being discriminated against because of their looks than because of their ethnicity.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">In a study published in the current issue of the American Journal of Sociology, Ellis P. Monk Jr., Michael H. Esposito and Hedwig Lee report that the earnings gap between people perceived as attractive and unattractive <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/715141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rivals or exceeds</a> the earnings gap between white and Black adults. They find the attractiveness curve is especially punishing for Black women. Those who meet the socially dominant criteria for beauty see an earnings boost; those who donâ€™t earn on average just 63 cents to the dollar of those who do.</p>
