<p>Today we&rsquo;re breaking down Weight Loss. To kick off Season 5 and this two part episode, Angela shares that the DVD commentary features commentary from The Office crew! The crew gives the lowdown on how they shot this episode that spans over an 8 week period. It was a continuity nightmare with fruit flies, goatees, and a cast member that had to have their shirt digitally altered in post. The ladies also break down an old tech alert that caused camera interference and we find out what&rsquo;s going on with Meredith&rsquo;s sunburnt face. Enjoy this episode now, so you can get in bed with your nice comforter, several cozy pillows, read a chapter of your book and have lights out by 8:30. That&rsquo;s how you sleep at night.</p>
