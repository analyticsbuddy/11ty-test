<p>Tech Twitter can get a bit…<em>much</em>…sometimes, so I thought I’d create a little post on where you can hang out <em>away</em> from there, while still keeping up to date with tech stuff.</p>
<p><strong>I’ll keep updating post this as I find more spaces, but to start, here’s some of my favourite chat-based communities.</strong></p>
<h2>Discords and Slacks</h2>
<p>I really like chat-based communities: especially when they are well-moderated and maintained. Over the last couple of years, they’ve really taken off and become the cornerstone of some great tech communities. Here’s some I’m either a member of, or know that they are very good.</p>
<h3><a href="https://piccalil.li/membership/">Piccalilli Discord</a></h3>
<p>Of course I’ll recommend this one! If you are a Piccalilli Supporter, you get access to a private Discord that is <em>full to the brim</em> with extremely lovely people. It has an <a href="https://piccalil.li/page/code-of-conduct/">enforced code of conduct</a> and is frankly, my favourite community on the web right now.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.patreon.com/shoptalkshow">Shop Talk Show Discord</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/davatron5000">Dave</a> host the <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show podcast</a>. Their friendly, approachable tone is very much the bedrock of their Discord which Patreon supporters get access too. It’s a lovely place.</p>
<h3><a href="https://generator.horse/">Brighton Generator Meetup Slack</a></h3>
<p>If you like creative spaces: this is the place for you. It’s got lots of really nice members in there who all make extremely cool stuff for the web (and beyond).</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/news/discord/">11ty Community Discord</a></h3>
<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>—I even <a href="https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/">made a course about it</a>. The community Discord is a great place to hang out with folks who also like this brilliant static site generator.  <a href="https://twitter.com/zachleat">Zach</a>—as you can imagine—runs a <em>very</em> tight ship too.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.partycorgi.com/">Party Corgi Discord</a></h3>
<p>This is another well-moderated, friendly space. This Discord is great if you like a buzzing place, full of people.</p>
<h3><a href="https://design.systems/slack/">Design System Slack</a></h3>
<p>If you want to see how to run a community, then these folks are the ones to watch. <a href="https://twitter.com/jina">Jina</a> has built this place up from scratch and considering how <em>massive</em> it is, it’s one of the nicest, safest communities there is.</p>
<h3><a href="https://array.chat">Array Freelancer Community</a></h3>
<p>Again, this is another one I run, specifically for freelancers. It’s very tightly moderated and very friendly. We’ve all got each other’s backs in there.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>This is an ever-updating post, so if you are a member of a great chat-based community or forum, <a href="mailto:hi@piccalil.li">send me a link</a> or drop a comment and I’ll check it out. I’m always up for joining nice spaces!</p>
